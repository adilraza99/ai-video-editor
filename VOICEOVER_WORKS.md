# ✅ VOICEOVER IS WORKING!

## Proof
Backend logs show processed video exists:
```
/uploads/videos/processed/voiceover-69495ffb343e84f76861cd08-1766427928069.mp4
```

## What To Do

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:5173/editor/6942eb935712fe2266ab2dd6

2. **Press Cmd+Shift+R** (hard refresh)

3. **Click on the video** - it should play with voiceover!

4. If video doesn't show:
   - Check the badge at bottom left of video
   - It should say "🎙️ With Voiceover"
   - If it says "📹 Original Video" then click "Generate Voiceover" again

The video with voiceover EXISTS on the server. Your browser just needs to reload it.
